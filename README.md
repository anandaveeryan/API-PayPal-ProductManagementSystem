# Description
 Created APIs for product management system. I've assumed the system with several modules like products, categories, brands, stores and users and created the APIs for those modules. The above swagger link can be used to test those APIs using mock data provided by the swagger. The productmanagementsystem.yaml file contains the yaml code for the defined APIs.
